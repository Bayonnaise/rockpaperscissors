# rockpaperscissors
=================

## Week 5 Friday challenge:

The task was to take a simple piece of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" code from github, get it working in Sinatra, then deploy it to Heroku in both production and staging environments. Once it was up and running I altered the code to track names and scores and reveal the winner of each round. Then I made it look good with some simple CSS.

### NewRelic

The NewRelic add-on offers a range of analytics tools for a Heroku site. It measures the response time of the various transactions, the Apdex T-value (the ratio of satisfactory to unsatisfactory response times), and the throughput in requests per minute (rpm), along with the error rate, CPU and memory usage.

Clicking the other tabs gives you more detailed analysis, including a list of requests that can be ordered by time consumption, response time, Apdex dissatisfaction and throughput.
