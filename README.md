# rockpaperscissors
=================

##Week 5 Friday challenge:

The task was to take a simple piece of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" code from github, get it working in Sinatra, then deploy it to Heroku in both production and staging environments.

I then installed the NewRelic addon, and used it to analyse the performance of my production deployment.

Finally, I expanded the base code with new features, and made it look good with CSS.
